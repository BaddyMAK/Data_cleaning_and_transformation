# Data Cleaning and Data Transformation 

In this article, I am going to present you all important points you need to know and to master, as a data scientist,
about data cleaning and data transformation, two fundamental processes that aim to provide high quality,
consistent and reliable data to build your model, finding proper insights or trends and taking the right decision.

## 2- Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the initial step each data scientist must apply before performing any further analysis or investigations. It is a procedure that helps determine duplicate, missing, inconsistent samples and remove them. It improves data accuracy and increases data quality via discarding invalid and unwanted information.

## 3- Data Transformation 
The data transformation step could be required either before data cleaning or between data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Data transformation before data cleaning, is the process of converting data from one format to another such as from JSON to CSV or data aggregation etc. After data cleaning, this process helps convert our cleaned data into useful information and more significant features. 

Some examples of data transformation are:

•	Aggregation: concatenate data from multiple sources and store them into a single format. 

•	Normalization: transform attributes to be on a similar scale e.g., from 0 to 1, which ameliorate model performance and training stability. 

•	Standardization: rescale data values so that its mean will be 0 and its standard deviation will be 1. The new data distribution fits standard normal distribution. 

•	Manipulation: data is transformed to render it more readable and organized. 

•	Attribute construction: adding one new attribute or more from existing ones.

•	Etc

## 4- Conclusion 
 
• Data cleaning returns high quality data which increases overall productivity, building valid model and simplify taking right decisions. 

•	Transformed data is easier to understand and to analyze either by computer or human. Raw data could be challenging to work with as it could be skewed and it has lot of defects.
